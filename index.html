		<p>Ralph is the hulking, giant-fisted "bad-guy" of the arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr., with the power to wreck anything he touches. Ashamed of his villainous role, Ralph embarked on a game-jumping adventure with hopes that earning a medal will make him a "good-guy". During his travels, he befriends a glitch named Vanellope. By using his strength to aid Vanellope in defeating an evil king, Ralph proves that he can be a hero despite his destructive programming.And thus proves that children's favourite Ralph is a Hero.</p>
